description: Generate and troubleshoot Bitbucket Data Center workflows with the bbdc CLI. Use when tasks mention bbdc, Bitbucket Data Center, pull-request lifecycle operations (list/create/update/merge/review/comments/blockers), authenticated-account lookups (recent repos, SSH/GPG keys, profile/settings), repository participant management, PR diffs/patches, or when translating natural-language Bitbucket requests into exact shell commands.

# Bbdc CLI

## Overview
Use this skill to translate natural-language Bitbucket Data Center requests into `bbdc` commands for the user to run locally, then summarize results from user-provided output.

Prefer this skill for pull request lifecycle work, authenticated account lookups, participants/reviewers, comments/blockers, rebase/merge checks, and batch PR workflows.

## Mode Selection
- Default mode is `generic`.
- Use `bbva` mode only when the user explicitly provides `Mode: bbva` or when user-level guidance (for example `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`) sets BBVA as the default.
- If the user explicitly provides `Mode: generic`, use `generic` mode.
- If instructions conflict and the mode affects execution, ask a single clarifying question.

## Quick Start
1. Resolve the executable:
   - Prefer `bbdc` if present in `PATH`.
   - Fallback to `python -m bbdc_cli`.
2. Determine the mode (see Mode Selection).
3. Execution model dependent on mode:
   - `generic`: prefer executing `bbdc` in Codex when available. If the user explicitly asks not to run commands, provide commands for the user to run.
   - `bbva`: never execute `bbdc` in Codex; always provide commands for the user to run locally.
4. Choose operation style:
   - Read-only inspection: use list/get/diff/activities style commands.
   - Mutating operation: create/update/review/merge/rebase/delete with confirmation-sensitive handling.

## Natural-Language Workflow
1. Classify the request:
   - Account lookup vs PR workflow.
   - Single PR vs multi-PR batch.
   - Read-only vs state-changing.
2. Extract required slots:
   - PR workflows: `project`, `repo` (and usually `pr_id`).
   - Account workflows: optional `user_slug` for profile/settings.
   - PR-targeted: `pr_id`.
   - Command-specific fields (reviewers, comment text, status, branch names, etc.).
3. If required slots are missing, ask focused follow-up questions before generating commands.
4. Build the narrowest command that satisfies the user request.
5. For mutating commands:
   - Show the exact command and expected effect before the user runs it.
6. Return:
   - Exact command(s) for the user to run.
   - Expected output fields to paste back.
   - One verification command when useful.

## Execution Rules
- Always require `BITBUCKET_SERVER` and `BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN`.
- Require `BITBUCKET_SERVER` to end with `/rest`.
- Execution is mode-specific: `generic` should prefer executing `bbdc` locally when available unless the user asks not to run commands; `bbva` must never execute `bbdc` in Codex and must return commands for the user to run.
- Prefer `--json` only when that exact command shows `--json` in `references/generated-command-inventory.md`.
- Never infer `--json` from command-family patterns.
- `account me` does not support `--json`; always use `account me` as-is.
- Use narrow pagination (`--limit`, `--max-items`) for exploratory calls.
- For mutating operations, describe the command and expected effect before user execution.
- Treat `merge`, `rebase`, `decline`, and `delete` as high-risk operations.
- Treat `pr batch ...` mutating commands as high-risk operations.
- In `bbva` mode, return command-only guidance: exact command(s) to run, expected output fields to copy back, and a short next-step command for verification.
- In `generic` mode, prefer running commands when available; fall back to command-only guidance when execution is not possible or the user asked not to run commands.
- In `bbva` mode, if an account command returns `HTTP 401`, explain that BBVA users typically authenticate with Project/Repository HTTP access tokens (not PAT), and those tokens may not access user-account endpoints.

## Command Routing
Use `references/command-map.md` for grouped commands and examples.
Use `references/nl-intent-playbook.md` for intent-to-command templates.
Validate command options against `references/generated-command-inventory.md` before returning final commands.

If the source CLI changed or command details are uncertain, regenerate a live command table from source:

```bash
python scripts/generate_command_inventory.py \
  --source <PATH_TO_BBDC_CLI_MAIN>
```

For full command coverage (including `pr batch ...`), refresh:

```bash
python scripts/generate_command_inventory.py \
  --source <PATH_TO_BBDC_CLI_MAIN> \
  --output references/generated-command-inventory.md
```

## Mutating Workflow Pattern
1. Generate state-inspection command(s) if needed (`pr get`, `participants list`, `comments get`).
2. If versioned endpoint is involved, allow auto-version behavior by omitting `--version` unless the user supplies one.
3. Provide the command for the user to execute.
4. Return:
   - Exact command generated.
   - Key fields to copy from output (IDs/URL/state).
   - Any follow-up command needed for verification.

## Common Tasks
- List open PRs:
  - `<bbdc-cmd> pr list -p <PROJECT> -r <REPO> --state OPEN --direction INCOMING`
- Create PR:
  - `<bbdc-cmd> pr create -p <PROJECT> -r <REPO> --from-branch <SRC> --to-branch <DST> --title "..." --reviewer <USER>`
- Review completion:
  - `<bbdc-cmd> pr review complete -p <PROJECT> -r <REPO> <PR_ID> --status APPROVED`
- File comments:
  - `<bbdc-cmd> pr comments list -p <PROJECT> -r <REPO> <PR_ID> --path <FILE_PATH>`
- Rebase check:
  - `<bbdc-cmd> pr rebase-check -p <PROJECT> -r <REPO> <PR_ID>`
- Batch approve:
  - `<bbdc-cmd> pr batch approve -p <PROJECT> -r <REPO> -f <FILE.json>`
- Account snapshot:
  - `<bbdc-cmd> account me`
- Dashboard pull requests:
  - `<bbdc-cmd> dashboard pull-requests --json`
- Account SSH keys:
  - `<bbdc-cmd> account ssh-keys --json`
- Account GPG keys:
  - `<bbdc-cmd> account gpg-keys --json`

## Output Normalization
When users ask for summaries, convert PR JSON into a Markdown table:

```bash
<bbdc-cmd> pr list -p <PROJECT> -r <REPO> --json \
  | python scripts/pr_json_report.py
```

## Troubleshooting
Use `references/source-behavior.md` for:
- strict enum values,
- version and comment-version auto-fetch behavior,
- endpoints implemented through `request_rest`,
- error semantics returned by the CLI.

In `bbva` mode, Codex-runtime network limitation pattern:
- `Request failed: HTTPSConnectionPool(... NameResolutionError ... Failed to resolve ...)`

When this happens:
1. Do not attempt local command execution in Codex.
2. Provide exact `bbdc` commands for the user to run locally.
3. Continue once the user shares command output.

In `bbva` mode, HTTP 401 for account endpoints:
- Treat as expected with BBVA HTTP access tokens.
- Tell the user this is token-scope behavior (not necessarily a wrong token).
- Prefer `account me` so partial results + `errors` can still be analyzed.
